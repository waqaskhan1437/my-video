1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,833
What if your entire video workflow ran completely on autopilot?

2
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:05,250
No more manual editing.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,868
No more repetitive posting.

4
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:08,333
Just pure automation.

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:17,960
Every day, content creators waste hours downloading videos, editing them into shorts, writing captions, and manually posting to every platform.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,222
It's exhausting and it doesn't scale.

7
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:23,373
Introducing Video Workflow Manager.

8
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:27,195
The all-in-one automation engine that handles everything for you.

9
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:30,413
Step one: Connect your video source.

10
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:34,424
Bunny CDN, FTP servers, or any cloud storage.

11
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:38,984
The system fetches videos automatically with smart filtering and rotation.

12
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:45,275
Step two: FFmpeg converts every video into six aspect ratios.

13
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:49,406
Vertical for shorts, square for feeds, widescreen for YouTube.

14
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:53,787
Crop or fit mode, custom durations, high quality encoding.

15
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,329
Step three: AI-powered captions.

16
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,259
OpenAI Whisper transcribes in over twenty languages with word-level timestamps.

17
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:05,162
Subtitles are burned directly into your videos.

18
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:08,689
Step four: Never run out of taglines.

19
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,451
Google Gemini or OpenAI generates unique text for every video.

20
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:17,643
Plus five thousand built-in viral taglines with emoji overlays.

21
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,987
Step five: Post to nine platforms simultaneously.

22
00:01:21,987 --> 00:01:29,844
YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels, Facebook, Threads, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Bluesky.

23
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:31,534
Scheduled or immediate.

24
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:34,783
Step six: Set it and forget it.

25
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:39,343
Automations run every few minutes, hourly, daily, or weekly.

26
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:43,867
Live progress tracking, detailed logs, and automatic error recovery.

27
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:46,532
The numbers speak for themselves.

28
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:56,354
Nineteen thousand lines of code, two hundred forty three functions, twenty three API endpoints, nine social platforms, and five thousand plus taglines.

29
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:58,318
Here's the magic.

30
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:05,568
Configure once, set your video source, choose your style, enable AI features, select platforms, hit start.

31
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:08,591
The engine runs automatically, every single time.

32
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:12,006
Ready to automate your entire video pipeline?

33
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,625

34
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:18,744
Self-hosted, fully customizable, built to save you hours every single day.

35
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:19,792
Let's get started.
