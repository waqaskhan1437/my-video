00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:08,310
What if your entire video workflow, from fetching raw footage to posting branded shorts on every social platform, ran completely on autopilot?

2
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:21,455
Every day, content creators and agencies waste hours downloading videos, editing them into shorts, adding captions, writing taglines, and manually posting to YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.

3
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,442
It's repetitive, exhausting, and it doesn't scale.

4
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,533
Introducing Video Workflow Manager.

5
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:36,584

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:39,163
Connect any video source.

7
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:43,064

Choose crop or fit mode.

12
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:07,432
Set custom durations and let the smart segment selector find the best starting point.

13
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:12,311

15
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:22,190

20
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:51,849
Schedule posts with custom timing, stagger them for maximum reach, or publish immediately.

21
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,118
Set it and forget it.

22
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,095

27
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,467
